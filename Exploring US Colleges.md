# Introduction

How'd you like to explore the landscape of 4-year colleges in the USA?  

My family and I answered this question a couple of years ago with an enthusiastic "We'd love to!"  Not because we have some great love for college exploration.  But, because our daughter was soon to embark upon that journey of life after high school.  Class of '16, she was excited about all the possibilities that college offered.  

And then....  Disillusionment ... bewilderment ... anxiety ....

Where to start?

In her case, she had earned a spot as a National Merit Finalist, so she rightfully thought the sky's the limit.  But what if her dream school(s) didn't accept her?  What was going to be her Plan B?  What if she was so sure she really wanted to major in a STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) field -- which she excelled at -- but instead wanted to pursue her music and art?  What about locale, region? Classmates, roommates, professors, campus ambience, etc. etc. etc?  And costs?

Well, thankfully, the U.S. Department of Education had just released its [College Scorecard]() data.  And to slap icing on that cake, [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com) had just started an open "swag" posting that [College Scorecard dataset]().  And the *coup de grace* -- I'm good with data  ([see me...](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mlthomps/).

So, I entered the Kaggle contest, won a nod as "Script of the Week" for January 10, 2016, and got a Kaggle t-shirt out of it!
