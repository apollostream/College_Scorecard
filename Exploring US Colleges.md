# Introduction

How'd you like to explore the landscape of 4-year colleges in the USA? If your answer is "Yes", here's the Bayesian-infused solution I created to do just that: [**"Best Colleges for You"**](https://thompsonml.shinyapps.io/BestCollegeApp/) -- (It's best to open that link in a new tab).

## Motivation

My family and I answered that question a couple of years ago with an enthusiastic "We'd love to!"  Not because we have some great love for college exploration.  But, because our daughter would soon be applying to colleges.  Class of '16, she was excited about all the possibilities that college offered.  

In her case, she had earned recognition as a National Merit Finalist, so she rightfully thought the sky's the limit.  But what if her dream school didn't accept her?  What was going to be her Plan B?  What if she wasn't so sure she really wanted to major in a STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) field but instead wanted to pursue her music and art?  What about locale, region? Classmates, roommates, professors, campus ambience, etc. etc. etc?  And costs?

And then ... where to start? Soon, excitement risked fading into disillusionment ... bewilderment ... anxiety<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> ....

## Solutions

I think early in the college search process, it's helpful to have a tool that can generate a ranked list of colleges that is customized for the student.  The typical free online resources are far too generic.  As template-driven filters, online tools just screen out everything not in the particular region, size or cost range you specify. Instead I set out to provide us with some level of customized prioritization -- importance weighting, if you will -- of the criteria driving our selection.  

Thankfully, just as we began the college search process, the U.S. Department of Education released its [College Scorecard](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/) dataset.  Better yet, [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com) had taken the dataset, made it readily useful, and hosted an open "swag" posting that [College Scorecard dataset](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/).  And the *coup de grace*, I'm good at math modeling, especially Bayesian analysis, & know my way around data ([see me...](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mlthomps/)).

So, I entered the Kaggle contest, won a nod as ["Script of the Week" for January 8, 2016](http://blog.kaggle.com/2016/02/19/december-2015-january-2016-scripts-of-the-week/), and got a Kaggle t-shirt out of it!

Encouraged by this outcome and looking to build an easy-to-use tool, I took things a step further and created a web-based R Shiny app to help us explore the landscape of 4-year colleges in the USA: ["Best Colleges for You"](https://thompsonml.shinyapps.io/BestCollegeApp/)!

## What of It?

In this post, I'll give you a quick run through of the "Best Colleges for You" app to give you an idea of what you might do with it.  Hopefully, the different college rankings it generates just for you will surface some college options you hadn't entertained yet and spark your imagination to explore further afield for a college that's right for you.

Also, for the data scientists out there, this post gives a brief description of the Bayesian bits and discrete choice modeling-motivated engine that drives the customized ranked lists that the app generates.

# Getting Started

# Bayesian Bits

Bayesian analysis really excels at inferring things about unobserved things -- whether they be events, values of variables, or assumed cognitive constructs in a persons mind -- from evidence supplied by measured and known things.  In the "Best Colleges for You" app, the unknown things are how strongly a student will value attendance at each college.  The measured things are the distributions of relevant student body properties, like test scores, admission rates, ethnicities, income distributions, future earnings, debt loads, etc. And the known things that fall into 3 categories:
1. Who the student is, like their test score, ethnicity, income, etc.
2. What the student prefers in a college, like the region in which it's located, the locale in terms of how urban or rural the campus is, etc.
3. How the student prioritizes the factors of the college experience in terms of four key dimensions:
   - "Risk" -- how much deviation from the student's own demographics and region of preference vs. alignment with the student's demographics and preferred region
   - "Vision" -- how much future-looking beyond college vs. short-term on-campus experience
   - "Breadth" -- how broad of a variety of academic disciplines available vs. concentration of degrees in a handful of disciplines
   - "Challenge" -- how stretching the academic rigor is relative to the student's capabilities vs. being well within the student's academic capabilities.
    
The app uses a *Probabilistic Graphical Model* representation of a *discrete choice model* to convert these factors and weights into a latent valuation of each of the more than 1000 4-year not-for-profit private and public colleges in the database, which in turn is converted into a choice probability amongst the top-*N* colleges shown in a ranked list.
