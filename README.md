# College_Scorecard Project 
R Markdown notebooks with analysis of the U.S. Dept. of Education College Scorecard database.

You'll need to download the SQLITE version of the College Scorecard database from Kaggle:  
+  [database.sqlite](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/college-scorecard/downloads/database.sqlite)  

Place the databse in your `../input` folder.  And place each of these scripts in your `../working` folder, which you'll set as your working directory using the R `setwd(...)` function. (I.e., `input` and `working` should be sibling folders residing in the same folder.)

# Kaggle Script: Part 1  

This is the 1st script I submitted to Kaggle for the College Scorecard dataset:   
+  ["Which College is Best for You_?"]().  (Originally appeared on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/apollostar/which-college-is-best-for-you).)

# Best College for You App  

And this is the resultant R Shiny app I built, hosted by the RStudio shinyio server (**best to open it in a new browser tab**):   
+  [Best College for You App](https://thompsonml.shinyapps.io/BestCollegeApp/).
